# ASCII
Converts a picture to ascii art

Simply import the package and call ASCII.ConvertToAscii and include the url of a png you want to convert.

It renders pixel by pixel and can be overwhelming for large photos. Try it out with small images to start with!

The output saves in a file called asciiImg.txt.
Copy and paste this into a text editor with a monospaced font for best results!

Example usage:

![hello](https://github.com/aelious/ASCII/assets/25186303/98fdc696-1ced-417a-a0c1-1c55c56dffa3)

After Conversion:

![png puppycat](https://github.com/aelious/ASCII/assets/25186303/bfd9e935-fa5f-4676-a309-e5a296755bfb)

Keep in mind these files can be massive so try to use small images. In the future I may rework this to work based on 10x10 pixels and take the average of each instead of converting the whole picture.
